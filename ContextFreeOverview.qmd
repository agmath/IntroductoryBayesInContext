## About

This document contains high-level draft outlines of the Bayesian concepts introduced and explored during each of our three initial classroom activities. The outlines here are for the *context-free* skeletons that will serve as the underlying framework that the discipline-specific activities will be built on top of.

## Activity 1: From the Prior to the Posterior

This activity introduces learners to the notion of the *prior distribution* and the *posterior distribution*. We expect that this may be the learners' first exposure to Bayesian methods, so the following concepts will be introduced and explained.

+ The *prior distribution*
+ The *posterior distribution*
+ The *likelihood function*
+ How the *posterior* distribution is obtained by multiplying the *prior* distribution by the *likelihood*

Beyond the initial exposure to the topics/concepts above, learners investigate three major questions in this activity.

1. How can the choice of *prior* influence the resulting *posterior* distribution?
2. How can the amount of data collected influence the resulting *posterior* distribution?
3. How do the choice of *prior* distribution and the *observed data* interact to influence the resulting *posterior* distribution?

## Activity 2: Estimating a Parameter with Credible Intervals

In this activity, we review the ideas from our first activity. Essential topics are the *prior* distribution and the *posterior* distribution. After a brief review, students are exposed to the notion of the *credible interval*. 

The main questions students will explore in this activity are:

1. What effect does the desired containment probability have on the bounds for the credible interval?
2. Is the credible interval symmetric about a point estimate?
3. Must the credible interval contain the point estimate obtained from sample data?

## Activity 3: Comparing Two Populations with Tests of Hypotheses
